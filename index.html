    <h1 class="h" id="am">about me</h1>

    <p id="firstp">The first thing you should know about me is that I hate writing about myself; 
    I get mad at the screen in front of me and my writing usually turns into ranting. 
    I apologize in advance for briefly throwing you into the trenches of my inner war. 
    The second thing about me is that I'm an autistic trans girl and therefore innately 
    destined to be a programmer. God, I wish that was true. I do sincerely love programming 
    and I'm getting better at it every day, but what I really am at heart is a writer. Not 
    that I'm innately good at writing either ‚Äî if I ever believed that, I'd face eternal 
    writer's block ‚Äî no, I'm a writer in that I see stories everywhere: in songs, in people, 
    behind every forgettable object, every menial tasks; I see stories in code. The path of 
    logic the computer travels, it's like a narrative to me, a hero's journey, and writing 
    that code is just as much of a story too. When you're finished with a project, you have 
    what all stories are: an expression. An expression of self, of intention, of action. 
    This is a perspective that's hard to describe; it doesn't make much sense to me either, 
    but what makes more sense is what drives it. I've felt excluded and outcasted from the 
    world for much of my life and so I have a deep need to feel like my presence and 
    existence impact it in some tangible way. The most fulfilling way I've found to achieve
    that is by making something. Taking something from within myself and seeing it manifest
    outside of myself. Making it real, and therefore, making myself real. If the fabric 
    of the universe is woven out of stories, adding more stories is the way to become 
    part of it. And that's why I'm trying to become what you would call a programmer. 
    I'm an autistic writer who thinks the language of computers is just as beautiful if not
    more so than the language of books. Thank you for your patience and for indulging me.

    <h3 class="h" id="exp">experience</h3>

    <p id="secondp">Experience is a tricky thing to talk about, especially for someone in my place in life. I could write out a list; it would be relatively short. As you might be able to tell from my repositories below, I'm just now learning how to program for the first time in my life. I could talk about my six months of food service industry work at a donut shop in late highschool where I learned how to fit into a workplace. I could talk about my time as an anthropology major where, last year (2022), I hit my first major dead end and learned how to face it, but I have so many more valuable experiences that don't fit into the typical resume perception of the word. I played vibraphone in an extremely competitive marching band where I learned the thrill of truely mastering something and sharing it with the world. I was involved in a climate activist organization called EarthStrike where I was a youth organizer for my state and learned about the power of believing in something. I've helped film, edit, and produce indy films with my dad where I learned the beauty of cooperative creativity. I've helped so many trans friends through mental health crises where I learned the value of people and our impact on eachother...</p>

    <p id="thirdp">I've gone through alot of struggle myself, and the friends that stuck with me were all fellow neurodivergent and disabled trans women with similar experiences. Despite being dispersed across the country and having vastly unique lives, many of them had one thing in common: programming. I‚Äôve been told and have seen firsthand that programming is a career for outcasts. And I don‚Äôt mean that in a disparaging way; after all, programming is what is bringing us all into the future, leveling playing fields with accessible encryption, providing information and education to people previously left in the dark. I didn‚Äôt make any friends in high school or‚ÄîI was either hated or pitied‚Äîand in college I was too shy, but I did make them on forums, image boards, in Discord servers, on voice calls, all places built on top of layers of code, by those very same nerdy outcast friends. As a kid, programming never seemed accessible to me; It was just something you learned at a fancy camp. I believe I am making strong progress in challenging that assumption; I have so many life lessons at my back to help me.</p>
