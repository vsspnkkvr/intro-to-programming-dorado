About me:

The first thing you should know about me is that I hate writing about myself; 
I get mad at the screen in front of me and my writing usually turns into ranting. 
I apologize in advance for briefly throwing you into the trenches of my inner war. 
The second thing about me is that I'm an autistic trans girl and therefore innately 
destined to be a programmer. God, I wish that was true. I do sincerely love programming 
and I'm getting better at it every day, but what I really am at heart is a writer. Not 
that I'm innately good at writing either — if I ever believed that, I'd face eternal 
writer's block — no, I'm a writer in that I see stories everywhere: in songs, in people, 
behind every forgettable object, every menial tasks; I see stories in code. The path of 
logic the computer travels, it's like a narrative to me, a hero's journey, and writing 
that code is just as much of a story too. When you're finished with a project, you have 
what all stories are: an expression. An expression of self, of intention, of action. 
This is a perspective that's hard to describe; it doesn't make much sense to me either, 
but what makes more sense is what drives it. I've felt excluded and outcasted from the 
world for much of my life and so I have a deep need to feel like my presence and 
existence impact it in some tangible way. The most fulfilling way I've found to achieve
that is by making something. Taking something from within myself and seeing it manifest
outside of myself. Making it real, and therefore, making myself real. If the fabric 
of the universe is woven out of stories, adding more stories is the way to become 
part of it. And that's why I'm trying to become what you would call a programmer. 
I'm an autistic writer who thinks the language of computers is just as beautiful if not
more so than the language of books. Thank you for your patience and for indulging me. 
I will not proofread this.
